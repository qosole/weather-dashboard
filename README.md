# Weather Dashboard

## Description 

A website that allows the user to search for a city anywhere on Earth and obtain weather data. This data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, as well as a less detailed forecast for the next five days. The user's search history is also displayed, and is saved into local storage.

This project helped me practice Bootstrap, Moment.js, and localStorage, and it was my first major attempt at creating a website that fetches data from server side APIs.
